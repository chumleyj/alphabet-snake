# Overview

This project is a version of the classic game Snake that was developed using the Python programming language. Users will be given an image of a word, and will seek to have the snake eat the appropriate letters for that word in order. 

If the snake eats the wrong letters, the snake will lose a life. If the snake loses all five of its lives, the game is over. The game will also end if the snake runs into a wall or if the snake runs into itself.

For each correct letter, the user will be given a point. For each word that is successfully spelled, the user will be given an additional ten points. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible, getting the highest possible score.

To play the game, please run the program from the main.py file.

Good luck!

# Future Work

* Add option to adjust the speed at which the snake travels in order to increase or decrease difficulty.
* Increase the number of potential words and create levels of difficulty. This would be done by grouping words by length and diffiuclty.
* Record the high scores of individual players, which can then be saved and displayed as a scoreboard when the game is started.
* Create randomized walls and barriers to increase the difficulty of play.
